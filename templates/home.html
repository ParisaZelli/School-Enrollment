Several factors contribute to the success of a world class enrollment team. One of these key ingredients lies in how efficient and responsive they are. Applicants are not only looking for personalized attention at each step but also looking to get it quick.
More than ever, relevant, valuable and timely information could be ample determinants in a prospect’s decision. And this ultimately links back to the enrollment system in place.
Enrollment systems, when implemented correctly, give admission teams a better leverage over student needs and motivations. The entire enrollment process, from contact to conversion, becomes seamless with a centralized system in place.
Let’s take an organized look at some of the reasons why automated enrollment systems have become a priority when it comes to the student enrollment enrollment.   
    
Not all enrolment management systems are created equal.
With much competition within this sector, there are several different online enrolment management solutions on the market, making it difficult to choose the right solution for your needs.
To help you make the right decision, we have put together a list of a few features to look out for when choosing the right student enrollment software for your needs.
These include:  

1.Inquiry Management: look for a solution that can store all enrolment enquiry and communication information and send out the relevant information when potential students ask questions.
2.Admission Analytics: data analytics is often an organisation’s biggest asset, which is the case with admission analytics.
These analytics will provide vital information related to the number of inquiries received to applications, incomplete or complete applications, demographic information, etc.
3.Task Management: automated systems that can assign tasks to admin teams and allow the monitoring and execution of these tasks are incredibly useful, especially where student enrolment is concerned.
4.Automated follow-ups: automated follow-up messages and responses enable you to continue to provide prospective students with the information they require and need even when your team is not online.

It is really difficult to have a generic definition for an education CRM because it is used very differently across various institutes.
It is tuned to manage certain aspects of the enrollment process; therefore it is very difficult to define it.
Let’s take the example of these aspects

1.Designing registration forms for events.
2.Single registration/multi registration criteria
3.Automatic invitations to the attendees
4.Sending reminder emails
5.Track cancellation of the event
6.Track attendance of the event
7.Send an email with a feedback form
8.Mark students who are interested in the enrollment

You can see this is one of the many micro-processes happening in an institute.
A CRM is fully capable of handling this whereas enrollment system or enrollment management system only deals with managing enrollment processes that are directly related to admission.
